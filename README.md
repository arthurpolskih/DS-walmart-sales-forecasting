# Sales Forecasting for Walmart Using Time Series Analysis

This project is part of my MBA program, where I aim to apply data science techniques to real-world business problems. The focus of this project is on sales forecasting using time series analysis, specifically aiming to predict sales during holiday periods. The dataset used comprises historical sales data from Walmart stores across various locations.
